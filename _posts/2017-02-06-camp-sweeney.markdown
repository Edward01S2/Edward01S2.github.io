Website built for a camp for diabetic kids. Worked with a team remoteley to create the site using Git to maintain code. Developed the dynamic upcoming events and video selector sections of the homepage. As well as the [activities](https://www.campsweeney.org/camp-life/activities/), [Sweeney Difference](https://www.campsweeney.org/for-parents/why-camp-sweeney/) and modular [events](https://www.campsweeney.org/camp-events/) page, as well as the styling for default interior pages.
